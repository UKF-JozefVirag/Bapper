With this script, you can:
1. Create a task / todo list by adding or deleting items, managing their statuses and adding list titles.
2. Sort the items, manually or by status.


INSTRUCTIONS:
1. To create a new ToDo List, simply drag the script "ToDoList" onto a GameObject in your scene, or select a GameObject and add the script by pressing "Add Component" in the very bottom of the Inspector.
2. To change the title of the new list, click the grey text field in the top of the Inspector that says "LIST TITLE", and change the text.
3. To add items to the list, press the blue "ADD ITEM" button in the bottom of the Inspector.
4. To change the content of an item, click the light grey text field with the default content "empty content item", and change the text. You can also input multiple lines of text.
